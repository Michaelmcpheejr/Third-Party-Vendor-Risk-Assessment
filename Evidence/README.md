# Evidence Repository (Portfolio Safe)

## Purpose

This folder represents the **evidence collection layer** of the Third Party Vendor Risk Assessment Program.

In a real enterprise TPRM process, vendors are required to provide supporting artifacts to validate questionnaire responses and confirm control maturity. These materials support:

- Audit defensibility  
- Control assurance  
- Risk remediation tracking  
- Executive risk reporting  

---

## What Belongs Here (Examples)

Typical evidence artifacts may include:

- SOC 2 Type II reports or ISO 27001 certificates (summary-level only)
- Incident Response plan excerpts
- Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity testing summaries
- Penetration test executive summaries
- Subprocessor transparency documentation
- Remediation closure confirmations

---

## Portfolio and Confidentiality Notice

This repository is intended for **portfolio demonstration purposes only**.

Do not upload:

- Real vendor contracts  
- Confidential SOC reports  
- Credentials or access exports  
- Production security documentation  
- Any sensitive or regulated data  

In a production environment, vendor evidence would be stored in a secure internal GRC system, not a public GitHub repository.

---

## Suggested Subfolder Structure (Optional)

You may organize evidence placeholders as:

- `evidence/soc2-and-certifications/`
- `evidence/incident-response-and-notification/`
- `evidence/business-continuity-and-dr/`
- `evidence/vulnerability-and-pen-testing/`
- `evidence/subprocessor-oversight/`
- `evidence/remediation-proof/`

---

## Naming Convention (Best Practice)

Use clear filenames such as:

`MM-DD-YYYY_vendorname_evidence-type_summary.md`

Example:

`02-02-2026_cloudhr_soc2_summary.md`

## Reviewer Note

The presence of this folder demonstrates how evidence is structured and managed in an audit-ready vendor risk management program.
