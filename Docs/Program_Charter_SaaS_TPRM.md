# Program Charter: SaaS TPRM Program (Third Party Vendor Risk Assessment)

## Purpose

Assess, monitor, and manage security and compliance risks introduced by third party vendors that access organizational systems, data, or services. Ensure vendor controls align with organizational standards and regulatory expectations.

## Scope

- Store, process, or transmit sensitive data
- Integrate via SSO, APIs, or privileged connections

- Medium Risk
- Low Risk

Primary driver: data sensitivity  
Secondary drivers: access level and operational criticality
