# SaaS TPRM Program (Third Party Vendor Risk Assessment)

## Overview

This Third Party Vendor Risk Assessment Program is an audit ready, reusable SaaS focused TPRM solution for organizations that want to reduce security and compliance risk introduced by third party vendors. The program assesses vendors during intake, tiers them using a risk based model, validates controls through a structured questionnaire and evidence checklist, and tracks remediation through to closure.

The program is designed to be leadership friendly without sacrificing rigor. It uses a hybrid workflow that keeps low and medium risk vendors lightweight while applying deeper assessment for high risk vendors. Continuous monitoring concepts are included to support ongoing oversight for high risk SaaS providers.
